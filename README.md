- Percentage of players in the NBA from ages 20 to 30
- Top 10 teams with the most amount of unique players in the last 30 years
- Total number of points per team in the last 5 years
- The relationship between age and points per game based on player position in the last 20 years
- Visualizing the relationship between "field goal percentage (FG%) and "field goal attempts (FGA) for players in the 10th and 11th season.
- What is the average points and assists per season for all players ages 19 to 30 years old who have played in more than 50 games in a season?
