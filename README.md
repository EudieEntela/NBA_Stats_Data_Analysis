In this project, I will try and answer a couple question and explain relation between data found:

- The teams with the lowest avg age vs the team with the highest avg for each year
- Teams with the highest and lowest average field goal percentage for each year and whether they made the playoffs or not
- Top 10 NBA Teams with the most player nominations for each year VS the least
- The Top 10 players with the most nominations for each year
- What is the collective points and assits per game for all players for ages 19 to 30?
- Who are the top 10 players that have played the longest in the NBA and how many awards have they won throughout those years?
